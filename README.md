## hi hi, im sienna!

- 🎓 Studying computer science as a junior at the University of Florida (Spring 2027 Grad).
- 👩‍💻 I’m currently exploring opportunities in cybersecurity, both in class and industry, to see if this is a permanent interest of mine.
- ✈️ I previously interned as a Cybersecurity Systems intern at Honeywell Aerospace, but only worked on proprietary code ;)
- 🎶 I adore the media and entertainment industry. Working on the engineering/technical side of live TV and music is a dream of mine!
